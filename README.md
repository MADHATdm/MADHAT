Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool, version 1.0

MADHAT is a numerical tool that implements a Fermi-LAT data-driven and model-independent analysis of gamma-ray emission due to dark matter annihilation/decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

If you use MADHAT, please cite the following papers:\
[1] K. Boddy, D. Kumar, D. Marfatia, and P. Sandick, Phys.Rev. D97 (2018) no.9, 095031, https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03826 \
[2] K. Boddy, S. Hill, J. Kumar, P. Sandick, and B. Shams Es Haghi, in prep.


MADHAT allows a model-agnositic analysis in the sense a user can independently choose a set of dwarfs and dwarf candidates to analyze, a J factor (and errors) for each object, and, if relevant, the dark matter mass and integrated photon energy spectrum.  Outputs include an upper limit (at a specified confidence level) on the number of photons that could have come from non-standard astrophysics, eg. dark matter annihilation or decay, and, if the dark matter mass and integrated energy spectrum are specified, an upper limit on the annihilation cross section.

## Output Options and Formatting

For parameter definitions, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03826.pdf.

 * PhiPP [cm^3 s^-1 GeV^-2]
 * +/-dPhiPP [cm^3 s^-1 GeV^-2] (uncertainty due to varying J-factor)
 * sigv [cm^3 s^-1]
 * +/-dsigv [cm^3 s^-1] (uncertainty due to varying J-factor)

Note: The cross section limit calculation assumes that the dark matter particles are their own antiparticles. If the dark matter is Dirac rather than Majorana, multiply the cross section by two. If the particle has some asymmetry between the particle and antiparticle, then the prefactor needs to be calculated. 

### Output Options
There are two optional output flags located in the file flags.dat, both of which default to "false". 

1. bool "fileout", on line 9 of flags.dat: If this is set to "true" then all run options print to a file []_[beta].out in the Output folder rather than to the screen.

2. bool "printbeta", on line 10
 of flags.dat: If this is set to "true" then for running with two or zero arguments (run options B and C), the output will be a table of Nbound(beta) for Nbound increasing as an integer up to the value [beta] passed as input.  Note that this output option is not defined for running with three inputs (run option A). Each line of the output will either have the format "beta, Nbound(beta), PhiPP, +dPhiPP, -dPhiPP, sigv, +dsigv, -dsigv" or "beta, Nbound(beta), PhiPP, +dPhiPP, -dPhiPP."  To output all values of (beta, Nbound), use [beta]=0.999 as input.

### Dwarf Sets

PMFs for 58 dwarfs and dwarf candidates determined with Fermi-LAT Pass 8R3 are included in the MADHAT 1.0 distribution.  There are ten pre-defined dwarf sets, including selected dwarfs and J-factors for each, located in the directory `Input`: \
Set1.dat [ref](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/110)\

To define a new dwarf set or enter new J-factor values, use the template SetTemplate.dat, which is a space-separated table of the following form:
```<pre>
############################################################
# MADHAT (Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool) 
# Dwarf Set: Template
#
# ID: Identify the Dwarf Galaxy to be analyzed
# J: Log10 of the J-factor, for J-factors specified in units of [GeV^2 cm^-5]
# +dJ: positive error in Log10(J)
# -dJ: negative error in Log10(J)
###########################################################
# ID    J       +dJ    -dJ
6	    20.76    	.24   	.30
10	   21.51	    .31	   .24
14	   20.99    1.08	   .37
23.  	20.57	    .36	   .21
24	   20.58    	.48   	.35
35.  	21.37    	.34	   .28
38	   20.54   	2.15	   .39
46	   21.63	    .44	   .28
```
where ID indicates the dwarf ID number (see Dwarf ID Numbers below), J is the Log10 of the J-factor, for J-factors specified in units of [GeV^2 cm^-5], and +/-dJ is the error in Log10(J).  For example, for dwarf ID 10:\
Log10(J)=21.51\
Log10(J+dJ)=21.51+0.31\
Log10(J-dJ)=21.51-0.24

A dwarf set file must contain, at a minimum, the ID numbers for the dwarfs to be considered.  It may also contain J-factors for each dwarf and J-factor errors.  Note that errors are not necessary, and if omitted, errors on PhiPP will print as zeros. Similarly, if the file only contains dwarf ID numbers, PhiPP will also print as zero. There are ten dwarfset.dat files included in the MADHAT package, plus a template file, SetTemplate.dat.

Note that all input files must end with a line of data (no additional newlines). Please reserve filenames SetN.dat, where N are integers, for dwarf sets defined in future versions of MADHAT.

### Dark Matter Mass and Integrated Photon Spectrum

The input file model.in must be located in the `Input` directory, and should have the following format:
```<pre>
############################################################
# MADHAT (Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool) 
# Dark Matter Model File: dmtest
#
# mass: DM mass in GeV
# spectrum: photon energy spectrum integrated from 1 to 100 GeV
###########################################################
# mass (GeV)   spectrum (1-100 GeV)
10      0.8734
50      7.7765
100     13.6097
500     33.6607
```
where the mass is a floating point number that specifies the dark matter mass in GeV and energy spectrum (1-100 GeV) is a floating point number that specifies the integrated photon energy spectrum between 1 and 100 GeV.  This file can be of arbitraty length, and must end with a line of data (no additional newlines).  The MADHAT package includes the dmtest.in template file, as well as four dark matter model files for two-body annihilation to b quarks, W bosons, muon pairs, and tau pairs.
