Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool, version 1.0

MADHAT is a numerical tool that implements a Fermi-LAT data-driven and model-independent analysis of gamma-ray emission due to dark matter annihilation/decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

If you use MADHAT, please cite the following papers:\

MADHAT allows a model-agnositic analysis in the sense a user can independently choose a set of dwarfs and dwarf candidates to analyze, a J factor (and errors) for each object, and, if relevant, the dark matter mass and integrated photon energy spectrum.  Outputs include an upper limit (at a specified confidence level) on the number of photons that could have come from non-standard astrophysics, eg. dark matter annihilation or decay, and, if the dark matter mass and integrated energy spectrum are specified, an upper limit on the annihilation cross section.
